# My Portfolio


## Description
  - This project is intended to kick off my work portfolio. Within the site you will see examples of a demo site I have created. At a later date I will add my resume and currently at the bottom you will find my various contact information. This site is 100% responsive for viewing on a variety of devices.

  ### What are the aspects of my website?
